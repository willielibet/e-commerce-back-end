  ## Description

E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms is a benefit for any full-stack web developer.

This e-commerce application requires the building of a back end for an e-commerce site. It also requires the configuration of a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

A link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality is provided below.
